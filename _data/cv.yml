    role: "Maintainer"
    summary: >
      An open-source software package for formulating and solving via a Cutting Plane method, 
      Lovász and Schrijver's Lift-and-Project semidefinite relaxations. Although this software 
      is designed to be as general as possible, allowing the application of the Lovász and 
      Schrijver's operator to any Linear Programming (LP) formulation, a strong emphasis has been 
      placed on LP relaxations of the Maximum Stable Set Problem (MSSP).

    role: "Contributor"
    summary: >
      A software package for solving mixed integer bilevel programs using branch-and-cut algorithm. 
      Such programs arise in the analysis of hierarchical decision systems with multiple, independent 
      decision-makers whose interests are not necessarily aligned.

    role: "Contributor"
    summary: >
      An open-source generic MILP solver, callable library, and extensible 
      framework for implementing customized solvers for mixed-integer linear programs 
      (MILPs). SYMPHONY has a number of advanced capabilities, including the ability 
      to solve multi-objective MILPs, the ability to warm start its solution procedure,
      and the ability to perform basic sensitivity analyses. 
      SYMPHONY has has been deployed in a variety of application areas, including 
      computational biology, wireless telecommunications, supply chain management, 
      transportation services, and air transportation.

#     summary: "In the second paper, he applied the quantum theory to light to explain the photoelectric effect. In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
