`Hello world!` Here you will find everything about my <a href='/research/'>research</a> and <a href='/software/'>projects</a>.

My research hinges mainly around discrete optimization, spanning both theory and computation.

I hold a Ph.D in Operations Research from [University of Rome Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home).
I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from [University of L'Aquila](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home).
Currently, I am a member of the Computational Optimization Research at the Lehigh `COR@L` group.
