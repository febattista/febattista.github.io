`Hello world!` I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href='https://www.usc.edu'>University of Southern California</a>.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at ISE Department of [Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise), under the supervision of Prof. Ted Ralphs. I hold a Ph.D in Operations Research from [University of Rome Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) and an M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from [University of L'Aquila](https://www.disim.univaq.it). 

My research lies at the intersection of theory, methodology, and computation in 
<span class="highligth">mixed-integer programming</span> and <span class="highligth">combinatorial optimization</span>, with 
particular focus on analyzing complex problems arising from various real-world applications.
